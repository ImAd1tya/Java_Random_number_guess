 Random Number Guess Game (Java)

#  About

This is a simple console-based number guessing game built using Java.

The user enters a minimum and maximum value, and the program generates a random number within that range. The user keeps guessing until the correct number is found.

This project is part of my Java learning journey.



# How It Works

* User inputs minimum and maximum range
* Program generates a random number between the range
* User guesses the number
* Program shows:

  * "Too low"
  * "Too high"
  * "Correct!"
* The game continues until the correct guess

##  Concepts Practiced 

* `Scanner` (user input)
* `Random` class
* `do-while` loop
* `if-else` conditions
* Range-based random number logic
